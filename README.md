I'm working through the Alien Invasion game project in *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes. I have been doing a few pages a day at a leisurely pace to make sure that I understand what is going on.  So far, it has been pretty enjoyable. 

The ship moves with the arrow keys.  Bullets can be fired with the space bar.  Game can be exited with the 'q' key.
